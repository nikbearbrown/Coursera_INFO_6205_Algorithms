    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary is faced with a classic computational challenge involving subsets of problem IDs. He needs to determine whether a subset of these IDs can sum up to a specific target value. This problem is closely related to the Subset Sum problem, which is known to be NP-complete. Your task is to formally prove that Beary’s subset problem is NP-complete by creating a function that explores potential solutions, demonstrating both the complexity and intractability of the problem.\n",

    "- The values of `problems` and `target` will be between 1 and 1000.\n",

    "   - Accurately shows that the problem is at least as hard as other NP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementation of Subset Sum Solution (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Correctly identifies subsets that sum to the given target.\n",
    "   - Uses a backtracking or dynamic programming approach to explore all potential subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explanation of Complexity (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes an analysis of why this problem is NP-complete, with references to subset sum characteristics and known complexity results.\n",

    "   - Code is well-organized, with clear variable names and structure.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic behind the subset exploration and backtracking or DP steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases that demonstrate the correctness of the solution.\n",
    "   - Considers edge cases such as an empty subset, all elements summing to target, or no subset reaching the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",

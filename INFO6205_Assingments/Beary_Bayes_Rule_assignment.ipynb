    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In his journey through the enchanted forest, Beary finds an ancient alchemist's lab filled with various magical ingredients. Each ingredient has a probability of success for creating a specific type of potion. Beary's challenge is to determine the optimal mix of ingredients to maximize the success rate of a powerful healing potion, given new evidence from the alchemist's notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary discovers that combining certain ingredients alters the success probability of the healing potion. Initially, he knows the individual success probabilities of each ingredient. However, the alchemist’s notes reveal interactions between ingredients that Beary must consider. Help Beary apply Bayes' Rule to update the success probabilities based on these interactions.\n",

    "### Bayes' Rule\n",
    "- Use Bayes' Rule to update the probabilities of success based on new evidence.\n",
    "- Bayes' Rule formula:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "  \\]\n",

    "  - \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability.\n",
    "  - \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood.\n",
    "  - \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Calculate the evidence as the sum of the product of priors and likelihoods.\n",

    "3. Return the list of updated probabilities.\n",

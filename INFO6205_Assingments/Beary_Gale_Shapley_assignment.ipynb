    "## The Gale-Shapley algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the stable matching algorithm, is applied to Berry the Bears grand feast. Berry wants to ensure that all guests are happily seated next to their preferred neighbors, and each seat has a preference for certain guests as well. By applying this algorithm, you can efficiently find a stable arrangement where no guest and seat would prefer each other over their assigned partners, ensuring that no one wishes to switch seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Details:\n",
    "1. **Input Structure**:\n",
    "   - You have `n` guests and `n` seats.\n",
    "   - Each guest has a list of preferences (`guests`), ranking seats from most to least preferred.\n",
    "   - Each seat also has a list of preferences (`seats`), ranking guests in order of preference.\n",
    "   - The preferences are complete, meaning every guest ranks all seats, and each seat ranks all guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Goal**:\n",
    "   - Find a stable matching between guests and seats. A matching is stable if there are no pairs (guest, seat) who would prefer each other over their current partners.\n",
    "   - Return a list where the index represents the guest, and the value at that index represents the assigned seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constraints**:\n",
    "   - The number of guests and seats is equal, and `n` is at most 100.\n",
    "   - This means both `guests` and `seats` are square matrices, and each sublist contains indices from 0 to `n-1`, representing the guests or seats ranked by preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "The **Gale-Shapley algorithm** is designed to find a stable matching in situations with mutual preferences:\n",
    "1. **Initialize all guests and seats as free**.\n",
    "2. **While there exists a free guest who hasnt proposed to every seat**:\n",
    "   - Select this free guest.\n",
    "   - The guest proposes to the highest-ranked seat they have not yet proposed to.\n",
    "   - If the seat is free, the guest and seat become matched.\n",
    "   - If the seat is not free and prefers this new guest over their current partner, they switch.\n",
    "   - If the seat does not prefer the new guest, the guest remains free and continues proposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "Heres how the Gale-Shapley algorithm is implemented in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "\n",
    "def stable_matching(guests: List[List[int]], seats: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    n = len(guests)\n",
    "    free_guests = list(range(n))\n",
    "    guest_partner = [-1] * n\n",
    "    seat_partner = [-1] * n\n",
    "    guest_next_proposal = [0] * n\n",
    "\n",
    "    while free_guests:\n",
    "        guest = free_guests[0]\n",
    "        seat = guests[guest][guest_next_proposal[guest]]\n",
    "        guest_next_proposal[guest] += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        if seat_partner[seat] == -1:\n",
    "            seat_partner[seat] = guest\n",
    "            guest_partner[guest] = seat\n",
    "            free_guests.pop(0)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            current_guest = seat_partner[seat]\n",
    "            if seats[seat].index(guest) < seats[seat].index(current_guest):\n",
    "                seat_partner[seat] = guest\n",
    "                guest_partner[guest] = seat\n",
    "                guest_partner[current_guest] = -1\n",
    "                free_guests.pop(0)\n",
    "                free_guests.append(current_guest)\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                continue\n",
    "\n",
    "    return guest_partner\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in the Algorithm:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: \n",
    "   - `free_guests`: List of all guests who are still looking for seats.\n",
    "   - `guest_partner` and `seat_partner`: Arrays to store the matched seat for each guest and the matched guest for each seat.\n",
    "   - `guest_next_proposal`: Tracks which seat each guest will propose to next.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proposal Loop**:\n",
    "   - For each free guest, the guest proposes to the next preferred seat.\n",
    "   - If the seat is free, the guest and seat are matched.\n",
    "   - If the seat is already matched but prefers the new guest, it drops the current guest and takes the new one.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, the guest continues to the next preferred seat on their list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return**:\n",
    "   - The list `guest_partner` shows the seat assignment for each guest, achieving a stable matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "Here are two examples to illustrate how the function works:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "guests1 = [\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [1, 2, 0],\n",
    "    [2, 0, 1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "seats1 = [\n",
    "    [2, 1, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [1, 2, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stable_matching(guests1, seats1))  # Expected output: [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "guests2 = [\n",
    "    [1, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "seats2 = [\n",
    "    [0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stable_matching(guests2, seats2))  # Expected output: [0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm efficiently finds a solution by ensuring that every guest and seat reaches a stable arrangement without needing to switch partners. This ensures a harmonious dining experience for Berry the Bears feast, with each guest happily seated."

    "\n",
    "In the mystical forest, Beary discovers a village facing water scarcity. The village has multiple water tanks (nodes) connected by pipes (edges), with each pipe having a capacity limit for water flow. Beary decides to help by optimizing the water distribution using the principles of network flow he recently learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an algorithm to maximize the water flow from the main reservoir (source) to the village's central distribution tank (sink) across a network of pipes and intermediary tanks. Each edge in the network has a capacity, and you need to ensure no pipe exceeds its water flow capacity.\n",

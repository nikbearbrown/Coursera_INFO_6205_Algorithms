    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary is developing an adventure planning platform to help his forest friends organize their travels efficiently. The platform needs to offer functionalities like sorting destinations based on various criteria (e.g., distance, popularity), caching frequently accessed destinations to speed up searches, and optimizing data retrieval for user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. **Sort Destinations**: Implement sorting algorithms to organize destinations by distance from the user and by popularity. For simplicity, use bubble sort for distance sorting and quicksort for popularity sorting.\n",
    "2. **Caching Popular Destinations**: To improve the platform's performance, implement a caching mechanism that keeps the top 5 most searched destinations. Use an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache strategy.\n",
    "3. **Optimize Data Retrieval**: Apply both sorting and caching techniques to optimize the retrieval of destinations based on user queries, ensuring quick access to the most relevant destinations.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubble Sort\n",
    "- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QuickSort\n",
    "- QuickSort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LRU Cache\n",
    "- An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is a fixed-size cache that discards the least recently used items first. This implementation can be done using a combination of a hash map and a doubly-linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Implement Bubble Sort for sorting by distance.\n",
    "2. Implement QuickSort for sorting by popularity.\n",
    "3. Implement an LRU Cache class with `get` and `put` methods.\n"

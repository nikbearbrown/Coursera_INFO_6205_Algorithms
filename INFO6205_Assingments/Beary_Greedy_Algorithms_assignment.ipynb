Each pot `i` contains `pots[i]` units of Golden Honey but is guarded by bees that require half as much regular honey to be distracted. Beary starts with a certain amount of regular honey. After collecting from a pot, he can use the Golden Honey as regular honey for future pots.\n",

    "Beary is on a quest to collect Golden Honey from various pots in the mystical forest. Each pot contains a specific amount of Golden Honey, but Beary needs to distract the bees guarding each pot by using regular honey.

    "   - Appropriately calculates and deducts the regular honey needed to distract the bees for each pot.\n",
    "   - Accurately adds the Golden Honey collected to the total regular honey available for subsequent pots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency and Optimization (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently sorts and iterates through the pots in a way that maximizes Golden Honey collection.\n",
    "   - Avoids unnecessary computations or redundant steps.\n",

    "   - Code is well-organized and includes clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic of the greedy approach and the handling of honey calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Cases and Edge Cases (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases that demonstrate correct functionality.\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as scenarios with minimal initial honey, varied pot sizes, and different pot quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",

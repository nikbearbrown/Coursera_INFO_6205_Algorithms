    "   - Uses BFS to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n",
    "   - Efficiently manages multiple targets (honey pots) and calculates paths between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling of All Honey Pots and Return to Start (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Ensures all honey pots are collected before returning.\n",
    "   - Accurately calculates the path back to the starting position after collecting all honey.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-structured and organized, with clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining key logic, especially for BFS implementation and movement between targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases for different grid configurations (e.g., with clusters of obstacles or honey pots at varying distances).\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as when there are no obstacles, or when all honey pots are in the same row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",

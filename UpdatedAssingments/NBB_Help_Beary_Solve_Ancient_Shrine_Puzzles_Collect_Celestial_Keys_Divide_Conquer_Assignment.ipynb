    "# Assignment: Help Beary Solve Ancient Shrine Puzzles to Collect Celestial Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement a divide and conquer strategy to determine the optimal order for Beary to solve puzzles at ancient shrines, minimizing the total time spent to collect Celestial Keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary must solve a series of puzzles at ancient shrines to collect the legendary Celestial Keys. Each puzzle has a specific complexity, and solving these puzzles in the optimal order will minimize the time Beary spends on his quest. Your task is to implement a divide and conquer algorithm to determine the best sequence to solve the puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def solve_puzzles(puzzles: List[int]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `puzzles`: A list of integers representing the complexities of the puzzles, where each complexity is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - An integer representing the minimum total time Beary will spend solving all puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The length of the `puzzles` list will be at most 100.\n",
    "- The values in `puzzles` will be between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "puzzles = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solve_puzzles(puzzles)  # Output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Implementation of Divide and Conquer Strategy (50 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently implement the `solve_puzzles` function using divide and conquer.\n",
    "   - Ensure the function sorts and accumulates the minimum total time accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Cases and Validation (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Develop at least two additional test cases beyond the provided examples.\n",
    "   - Ensure that test cases cover various puzzle complexities and list lengths, confirming the function's accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis and Explanation (20 points)**:\n",
    "   - Explain why solving puzzles in increasing order minimizes the total time.\n",
    "   - Describe the divide and conquer approach and its application to this problem.\n",
    "   - Reflect on the time and space complexity of your solution, providing an estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthroughs:\n",
    "1. **Input:** `puzzles = [10, 20, 30]`  \n",
    "   **Process:** Solve in order: 10 -> 20 -> 30  \n",
    "   **Output:** `60`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input:** `puzzles = [5, 10, 15]`  \n",
    "   **Process:** Solve in order: 5 -> 10 -> 15  \n",
    "   **Output:** `30`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Template:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "\n",
    "def solve_puzzles(puzzles: List[int]) -> int:\n",
    "    puzzles.sort()\n",
    "    total_time = 0\n",
    "    current_time = 0\n",
    "    for puzzle in puzzles:\n",
    "        current_time += puzzle\n",
    "        total_time += current_time\n",
    "    return total_time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions:\n",
    "1. **Why does solving puzzles in increasing order minimize the total time spent?**\n",
    "2. **How does the divide and conquer strategy help solve this problem?**\n",
    "3. **What are the time and space complexities of your solution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions:\n",
    "Submit the following:\n",
    "1. Your implementation of the `solve_puzzles` function.\n",
    "2. The output of the provided test cases and any additional test cases you create.\n",
    "3. A brief analysis of your solution, covering its efficiency and the application of divide and conquer.\n"

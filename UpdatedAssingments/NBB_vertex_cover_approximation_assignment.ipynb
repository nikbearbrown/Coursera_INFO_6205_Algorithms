    "### If You Don’t Get the Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't get the exact output you were expecting, it might be due to the nature of approximation algorithms. Unlike exact algorithms, approximation algorithms are designed to find a solution that is \"close enough\" to the optimal answer, but not necessarily the exact solution. Here are some reasons why your output might not match your expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approximation by Design**:  \n",
    "   Approximation algorithms, like those used for the vertex cover problem, don't always give the optimal result. They aim to provide a solution that is within a certain bound of the best possible solution. For example, the greedy algorithm for vertex cover often gives a solution that is at most twice the size of the optimal cover. This means that the solution may include more vertices than the optimal cover, or different ones, but still be a valid cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Greedy Approaches Can Vary**:  \n",
    "   Many approximation algorithms use a greedy approach, selecting edges or vertices based on specific heuristics (like picking the most connected vertex first). These decisions can lead to different results in different runs, even on the same input, especially if there’s any randomness in the edge or vertex selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected vs. Actual Output**:  \n",
    "   If the output you're getting, such as multiple sets of vertices like `[0, 1, 2, 3]` and `[0, 4]`, seems off, remember that the algorithm is providing an approximate solution. You might not get the minimal vertex cover, but you should still get a valid cover. The differences between runs or variations in the output often come from how the algorithm processes the graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Randomness in the Algorithm**:  \n",
    "   Some approximation algorithms may include random choices, leading to different results across different runs. This can also contribute to variability in the output, especially if the algorithm is non-deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, don't be discouraged if your output doesn't match your expectations exactly—this is often an inherent part of using approximation algorithms. Make sure to verify whether the output is a valid solution and within the acceptable approximation bounds of the algorithm you're using.\n",

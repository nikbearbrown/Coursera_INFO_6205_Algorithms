    "# Assignment: Help Beary Map and Explore the Wild Woods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to help Beary explore the Wild Woods, represented as a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "The Wild Woods consist of various points of interest connected by paths, which form a directed graph. Beary needs to explore all reachable points from a starting location. Implement DFS and BFS algorithms to allow Beary to explore the forest efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signatures:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dfs(graph: Dict[int, List[int]], start: int) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def bfs(graph: Dict[int, List[int]], start: int) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `graph`: A dictionary where keys are integers representing points of interest (nodes) and values are lists representing directed paths to other points.\n",
    "  - `start`: An integer representing the starting node for both DFS and BFS traversals.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - A list of integers representing the order in which nodes are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The graph is directed and can contain cycles.\n",
    "- The graph is represented with nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    0: [1, 2],\n",
    "    1: [2],\n",
    "    2: [0, 3],\n",
    "    3: [3]\n",
    "}\n",
    "start = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dfs(graph, start))  # Example output: [2, 0, 1, 3]\n",
    "print(bfs(graph, start))  # Example output: [2, 0, 3, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of DFS (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Traverses all reachable nodes from the starting node in a depth-first manner.\n",
    "   - Handles cycles without getting stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct Implementation of BFS (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Traverses all reachable nodes from the starting node in a breadth-first manner.\n",
    "   - Correctly handles different graph structures, including cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency and Optimization (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently handles graph traversal using appropriate data structures (stack for DFS and queue for BFS).\n",
    "   - Manages time complexity and avoids unnecessary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-structured with clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic behind DFS and BFS traversal methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases to demonstrate correct functionality and handling of various graph structures, such as graphs with cycles, disconnected nodes, and different traversal starting points.\n"

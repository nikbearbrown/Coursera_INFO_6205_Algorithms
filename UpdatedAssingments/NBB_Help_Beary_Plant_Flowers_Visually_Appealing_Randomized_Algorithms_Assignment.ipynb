    "# Assignment: Help Beary Plant Flowers in a Visually Appealing Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement a randomized algorithm that minimizes the number of adjacent flowers with the same color in Beary's garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary wants to plant a row of flowers in his garden, where each flower has a specific color represented by an integer. To create a visually appealing pattern, he aims to avoid planting flowers of the same color next to each other. Your task is to implement a randomized algorithm that arranges the flowers such that the number of adjacent flowers with the same color is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plant_flowers(colors: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `colors`: A list of integers where each integer represents the color of a flower.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Returns a list of integers representing the arranged flowers, such that the number of adjacent flowers with the same color is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The list `colors` will contain at most 100 elements.\n",
    "- Each element in `colors` will be an integer between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "colors = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plant_flowers(colors)  # Expected output: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Randomized Algorithm (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently randomizes the flower arrangement to reduce adjacent duplicates.\n",
    "   - Handles cases where certain colors appear more frequently than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effective Minimization of Adjacent Same Colors (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Iteratively improves the arrangement to minimize adjacent flowers of the same color.\n",
    "   - Compares different arrangements and selects the one with the fewest adjacent duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of Randomization and Heuristics (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Utilizes random shuffling and a counting heuristic to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is organized, with descriptive variable names and structured logic.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining key parts of the algorithm, especially random shuffling and adjacent color checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Tests with varied flower color frequencies and different list lengths.\n",
    "   - Ensures robustness for cases with a high number of same colors or single color arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases that demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness for different color arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment provides an opportunity to work with randomized algorithms and heuristics, optimizing arrangements for visual appeal through iterative improvements.\n"

    "# Assignment: Help Beary Navigate the Forest to Collect Honey\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement an algorithm that helps Beary collect all honey pots in the forest and return to his starting position in the shortest number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "The forest is represented as a grid where some cells contain honey pots (`H`), obstacles (`O`), or are empty (`.`). Beary starts at a specified cell (`B`), and his goal is to navigate through the forest to collect all honey pots and return to the starting position using the shortest path possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_shortest_path(grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `grid`: A 2D list where each element is a character representing:\n",
    "    - `'B'`: Beary’s starting position.\n",
    "    - `'H'`: A honey pot to be collected.\n",
    "    - `'O'`: An obstacle that Beary cannot pass through.\n",
    "    - `'.'`: An empty cell that Beary can move through.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Returns an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to collect all honey pots and return to the starting position. If it’s impossible, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The grid will contain at least one `'B'` and one `'H'`.\n",
    "- The grid’s dimensions are at most 50x50.\n",
    "- There is always a valid path for Beary to collect all honey pots and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grid = [\n",
    "    ['B', '.', 'H'],\n",
    "    ['O', 'O', '.'],\n",
    "    ['H', '.', 'H']\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "find_shortest_path(grid)  # Expected output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Pathfinding Algorithm (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Successfully navigates to all honey pots and returns to the starting position.\n",
    "   - Accurately handles grid boundaries and obstacle avoidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimal Use of BFS for Shortest Path (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Uses BFS to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n",
    "   - Efficiently manages multiple targets (honey pots) and calculates paths between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling of All Honey Pots and Return to Start (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Ensures all honey pots are collected before returning.\n",
    "   - Accurately calculates the path back to the starting position after collecting all honey.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-structured and organized, with clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining key logic, especially for BFS implementation and movement between targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases for different grid configurations (e.g., with clusters of obstacles or honey pots at varying distances).\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as when there are no obstacles, or when all honey pots are in the same row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases demonstrating functionality for various grid layouts and conditions.\n"

    "\n",
    "Beary finds himself in an ancient alchemist's lab, where he has access to magical ingredients needed to create a powerful healing potion. Each ingredient has an initial probability of success based on past experience. However, after discovering the alchemist's hidden notes, Beary learns that interactions between the ingredients could improve or reduce their success rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beary needs to combine these ingredients optimally by using **Bayesian inference** to update the initial success probabilities for each ingredient based on the new evidence from the alchemist's notes. Your task is to help Beary by implementing the function `optimize_potion(ingredients, evidence)`.\n",

    "4. **Output:**\n",

    "   - **Step 1**: Calculate the total evidence, which is the sum of the product of the priors and likelihoods for each ingredient.\n",

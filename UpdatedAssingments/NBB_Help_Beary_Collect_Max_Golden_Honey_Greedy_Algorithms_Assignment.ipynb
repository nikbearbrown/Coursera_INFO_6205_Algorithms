    "# Assignment: Help Beary Collect the Maximum Amount of Golden Honey\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement a greedy algorithm that helps Beary collect the maximum amount of Golden Honey from pots guarded by bees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary is on a quest to collect Golden Honey from various pots in the mystical forest. Each pot contains a specific amount of Golden Honey, but Beary needs to distract the bees guarding each pot by using regular honey. For each pot, Beary needs half the amount of Golden Honey in regular honey to proceed. He starts with a certain amount of regular honey and can use collected Golden Honey as regular honey for future pots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def collect_golden_honey(pots: List[int], regular_honey: int) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `pots`: A list of integers where each element represents the Golden Honey in a specific pot.\n",
    "  - `regular_honey`: An integer representing the initial amount of regular honey Beary has.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - An integer representing the maximum amount of Golden Honey Beary can collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The number of pots will be at most 100.\n",
    "- The values of `pots` and `regular_honey` will be between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pots = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "regular_honey = 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collect_golden_honey(pots, regular_honey)  # Expected output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Greedy Algorithm (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Correctly prioritizes collecting from pots with the highest Golden Honey first.\n",
    "   - Successfully handles all input values within the specified constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling of Regular Honey Requirements (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Appropriately calculates and deducts the regular honey needed to distract the bees for each pot.\n",
    "   - Accurately adds the Golden Honey collected to the total regular honey available for subsequent pots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency and Optimization (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently sorts and iterates through the pots in a way that maximizes Golden Honey collection.\n",
    "   - Avoids unnecessary computations or redundant steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-organized and includes clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic of the greedy approach and the handling of honey calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Cases and Edge Cases (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases that demonstrate correct functionality.\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as scenarios with minimal initial honey, varied pot sizes, and different pot quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases that validate the implementation, ensuring it handles a range of inputs and conditions.\n"

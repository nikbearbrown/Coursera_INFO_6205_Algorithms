    "# Assignment: Optimize Water Distribution in Beary's Village\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to optimize the water distribution in Beary's village by maximizing water flow from the main reservoir to the central distribution tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary's village is facing water scarcity, and the water distribution network consists of several water tanks (nodes) connected by pipes (edges) with specific capacities. Your task is to use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to maximize the water flow from the main reservoir (source) to the village's central distribution tank (sink) while respecting the capacities of the pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def maximize_water_flow(network: List[List[int]], source: int, sink: int) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `network`: A 2D list where `network[i][j]` represents the capacity of the pipe from node `i` to node `j`.\n",
    "  - `source`: An integer representing the main reservoir node.\n",
    "  - `sink`: An integer representing the central distribution tank.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Returns an integer representing the maximum water flow from the source to the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The number of nodes (`n`) will be at most 100.\n",
    "- The values in `network` will be between 0 and 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "network = [\n",
    "    [0, 16, 13, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 10, 12, 0, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 4, 0, 0, 14, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 20],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 4],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "source = 0\n",
    "sink = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "maximize_water_flow(network, source, sink)  # Expected output: 23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Accurately identifies augmenting paths and correctly updates the flow along these paths.\n",
    "   - Handles the updating of residual capacities and reverse flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Use of BFS for Pathfinding (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Uses BFS effectively to find augmenting paths and ensures all capacities are respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling of Residual Networks (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Manages the residual network, adjusting capacities for forward and backward edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-organized with descriptive variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic behind each step, especially BFS and flow updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases for various network configurations, such as multiple paths and capacity constraints.\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as no augmenting paths or all paths having the same capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases that demonstrate the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness for different network configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will challenge students to understand and implement a complex algorithm for network flow, applying it to a real-world scenario to optimize resource distribution.\n"

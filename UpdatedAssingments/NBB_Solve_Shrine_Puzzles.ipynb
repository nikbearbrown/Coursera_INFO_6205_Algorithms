    "### Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary is on a heroic quest to prevent an eternal winter from freezing the land. To succeed, he must collect the legendary **Celestial Keys** from ancient shrines. Each shrine is guarded by a puzzle that increases in difficulty. The more complex the puzzle, the more mentally taxing it becomes for Beary, and solving puzzles one after the other leads to increasing mental fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bearyâ€™s challenge is to determine the **optimal order** to solve the puzzles so that the total time spent is minimized. The key to success is implementing an efficient **divide and conquer strategy** to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the function `solve_puzzles(puzzles)` that determines the best order in which Beary should solve the puzzles to minimize the total time.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - An integer representing the minimum total time Beary will spend solving all puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constraints:**\n",
    "   - The length of the `puzzles` list will be at most 100.\n",
    "   - The values in `puzzles` will be between 1 and 1000.\n",

    "   - Split the list of puzzle complexities into smaller sublists.\n",

    "3. **Combine:**\n",
    "   - Merge the solutions of the subproblems to determine the overall minimum time spent solving all puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize:**\n",
    "   - Sort the puzzles by complexity, solve them in increasing order, and accumulate the time spent solving each puzzle to minimize the total time Beary spends.\n",

    "# Assignment: Prove the Complexity of Beary's Subset Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To prove that Beary’s subset problem is NP-complete by demonstrating the intractability of determining whether a subset with a sum equal to a given number exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary is faced with a classic computational challenge involving subsets of problem IDs. He needs to determine whether a subset of these IDs can sum up to a specific target value. This problem is closely related to the Subset Sum problem, which is known to be NP-complete. Your task is to formally prove that Beary’s subset problem is NP-complete by creating a function that explores potential solutions, demonstrating both the complexity and intractability of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prove_np_complete(problems: List[int], target: int) -> bool:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `problems`: A list of integers representing problem IDs.\n",
    "  - `target`: An integer representing the target sum that Beary is trying to find among a subset of the problem IDs.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Returns a boolean value indicating whether there exists a subset of `problems` that sums to `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The length of `problems` will be at most 100.\n",
    "- The values of `problems` and `target` will be between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "problems = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]\n",
    "target = 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prove_np_complete(problems, target)  # Expected output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correctness of NP-Completeness Proof (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Clearly demonstrates the intractability of the problem through both code and explanation.\n",
    "   - Accurately shows that the problem is at least as hard as other NP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementation of Subset Sum Solution (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Correctly identifies subsets that sum to the given target.\n",
    "   - Uses a backtracking or dynamic programming approach to explore all potential subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explanation of Complexity (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes an analysis of why this problem is NP-complete, with references to subset sum characteristics and known complexity results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-organized, with clear variable names and structure.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic behind the subset exploration and backtracking or DP steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases and Validation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes test cases that demonstrate the correctness of the solution.\n",
    "   - Considers edge cases such as an empty subset, all elements summing to target, or no subset reaching the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include an explanation or proof outline that discusses the NP-completeness of the subset sum problem in relation to Beary’s challenge.\n"

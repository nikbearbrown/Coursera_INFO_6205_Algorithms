    "# Assignment: Help Beary Arrange a Grand Feast with Stable Seating Arrangements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching, ensuring Beary’s grand feast features a harmonious seating arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary is hosting a grand feast for various forest animals, where each guest has a preferred list of seats, and each seat also has a preference list for certain guests. Implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find a stable seating arrangement, where no guest and seat would prefer each other over their current match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def stable_matching(guests: List[List[int]], seats: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `guests`: A list of lists where each sublist contains the seating preferences of a guest, ranking seats from most to least preferred.\n",
    "  - `seats`: A list of lists where each sublist contains the guest preferences of a seat, ranking guests from most to least preferred.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - A list where each index represents a guest, and the value at that index is the assigned seat for that guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The number of guests and seats are equal, with a maximum of 100.\n",
    "- Every guest and seat has a complete preference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "guests = [\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [1, 2, 0],\n",
    "    [2, 0, 1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "seats = [\n",
    "    [2, 1, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [1, 2, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(stable_matching(guests, seats))  # Expected output: [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Gale-Shapley Algorithm (40 points)**:\n",
    "   - Ensures that the matching is stable by iterating through guests and their preferences.\n",
    "   - Correctly handles proposals and rejections based on preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling of Preferences (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Accurately processes and maintains both guest and seat preferences.\n",
    "   - Correctly handles all edge cases, ensuring each guest and seat are matched according to their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency and Optimization (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Algorithm runs efficiently within a reasonable time frame given the maximum constraints (100 guests/seats).\n",
    "   - Avoids unnecessary loops or redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-organized with clear variable names.\n",
    "   - Includes comments explaining the logic and flow of the Gale-Shapley algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Cases and Edge Cases (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Includes multiple test cases demonstrating the algorithm’s correctness.\n",
    "   - Accounts for edge cases, such as scenarios where preferences might be inversely ranked or identical for multiple guests/seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Ensure that all test cases are included, showing correct functionality of the algorithm under different scenarios.\n"

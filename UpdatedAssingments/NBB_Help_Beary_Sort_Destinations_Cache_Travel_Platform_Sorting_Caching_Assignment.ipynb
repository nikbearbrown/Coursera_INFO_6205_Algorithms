    "# Assignment: Help Beary Sort Destinations and Cache Popular Ones for His Travel Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To implement sorting algorithms for organizing destinations and an LRU cache for frequently accessed destinations to optimize Beary's travel platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary's travel platform needs to sort destinations by distance and popularity. Additionally, to enhance performance, the platform should cache the top 5 most searched destinations using an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache strategy. Your task is to implement Bubble Sort for sorting by distance, QuickSort for sorting by popularity, and an LRU cache for optimizing frequently accessed destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signatures:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def quicksort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class LRUCache:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, capacity: int):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get(self, key: int) -> int:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - `arr`: A list of integers representing destination attributes (e.g., distances or popularity).\n",
    "  - `capacity`: An integer representing the LRU cache capacity (for this task, assume a fixed capacity of 5).\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - The sorting functions return a sorted list of integers.\n",
    "  - The LRU cache supports `get` and `put` operations and evicts the least recently used item when capacity is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The list `arr` will contain up to 1000 elements.\n",
    "- Each element in `arr` will be an integer between 1 and 10,000.\n",
    "- The LRU cache capacity is fixed at 5 for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = [10, 3, 15, 7, 8, 23, 74]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bubble_sort(arr)  # [3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 23, 74]\n",
    "quicksort(arr)    # [3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 23, 74]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Correct Implementation of Bubble Sort for Distance (20 points)**:\n",
    "   - Correctly sorts the list of distances using Bubble Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct Implementation of QuickSort for Popularity (20 points)**:\n",
    "   - Accurately sorts the list of popularity values using QuickSort.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficient Implementation of LRU Cache (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Implements an LRU cache that handles `get` and `put` operations correctly.\n",
    "   - Ensures the cache evicts the least recently used item when capacity is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combination of Sorting and Caching for Data Optimization (20 points)**:\n",
    "   - Effectively combines sorting and caching to optimize data retrieval for destination attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Code is well-organized, with descriptive variable names and includes comments explaining each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your solution as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the sorting and caching functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment helps students learn sorting techniques and understand how caching can optimize data retrieval by combining algorithms and data structures.\n"

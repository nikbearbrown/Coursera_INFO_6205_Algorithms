    "# Assignment: Help Beary Navigate the Maze of Wisdom\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Points: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To apply dynamic programming principles alongside BFS to solve a maze navigation problem with potential obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Beary needs to find the shortest path through the Maze of Wisdom, moving only right or down. The maze can add one additional obstacle to any open cell after Beary starts. Implement a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum steps needed to reach the treasure, accounting for this potential new obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def navigate_maze(maze: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Input**: \n",
    "  - A 2D list `maze`, where `0` indicates an open path and `1` indicates an obstacle.\n",
    "- **Output**: \n",
    "  - An integer indicating the minimum number of steps required for Beary to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid from the top-left corner, considering the possibility of one additional obstacle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The maze will have dimensions at most 50x50.\n",
    "- The values in `maze` will be either `0` or `1`.\n",
    "- There will always be at least one valid path to the treasure initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "maze = [\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 1, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(navigate_maze(maze))  # Expected output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria:\n",
    "1. **Implementation of BFS without DP (20 points)**:\n",
    "   - Correctly implements a basic BFS approach to find the minimum steps to the treasure without considering the added obstacle.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Integrating Dynamic Programming with BFS (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently integrates DP to optimize the BFS, storing intermediate results and reusing calculations to reduce time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling the Additional Obstacle (30 points)**:\n",
    "   - Simulates the addition of an obstacle by evaluating multiple paths with possible new obstacles.\n",
    "   - Correctly identifies the optimal path considering the extra obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Efficiency and Optimization (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - Optimizes the algorithm to run within a reasonable time for large inputs (50x50 grid).\n",
    "   - Avoids unnecessary recomputation by effectively using DP.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Readability and Documentation (10 points)**:\n",
    "   - The code is well-documented, with clear variable names and comments explaining key sections.\n",
    "   - Proper use of functions and clear organization of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit your code in a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) on the learning platform.\n",
    "- Include test cases demonstrating different scenarios, such as cases with and without additional obstacles.\n"

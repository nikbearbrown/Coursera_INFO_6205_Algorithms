# What is Manim?

Manim is a powerful animation engine created by mathematician Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) for generating explanatory math videos. It's a Python library that allows you to create precise, programmatic animations for explaining mathematical and algorithmic concepts through beautiful visualizations.

Key features of Manim include:
- Mathematical equation rendering using LaTeX
- Geometric shapes and transformations
- Graph plotting and visualization
- Animation of algorithms and data structures
- Camera movements and scene transitions
- Timeline-based animation control

Manim is particularly well-suited for creating educational content about algorithms because it allows you to:
1. Visualize step-by-step execution
2. Highlight key operations
3. Show data transformations
4. Create consistent, professional-looking animations
5. Script complex sequences for repeatability

## How to Install Manim

There are currently two main versions of Manim:
1. **ManimCE (Community Edition)** - The most actively maintained version
2. **ManimGL** - Grant's original version with OpenGL rendering

For algorithm visualizations, ManimCE is generally recommended due to its active community and better documentation. Here's how to install it:

### Prerequisites

Before installing Manim, you'll need:
- Python 3.7 or newer
- FFmpeg (for video rendering)
- LaTeX (for rendering mathematical expressions)
- Various system dependencies

### Installation Steps by Operating System

#### Windows:

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Install FFmpeg**:
   - Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use Chocolatey:
   ```
   choco install ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Install LaTeX** (MiKTeX is recommended):
   - Download from [miktex.org](https://miktex.org/download)
   - During installation, select "Install missing packages on the fly"

4. **Install Manim**:
   ```
   pip install manim
   ```

#### macOS:

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   brew install python ffmpeg cairo pango scipy
   ```

3. **Install LaTeX**:
   ```
   brew install --cask mactex
   ```

4. **Install Manim**:
   ```
   pip install manim
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev ffmpeg
   ```

2. **Install LaTeX**:
   ```
   sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-science texlive-xetex
   ```

3. **Install Manim**:
   ```
   pip3 install manim
   ```

### Verifying the Installation

After installation, verify that Manim is working correctly:

```python
from manim import *

class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        square = Square()
        circle = Circle()
        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.wait()

# Save this as test_manim.py
```

Run it with:
```
manim -pql test_manim.py SquareToCircle
```

The `-pql` flags mean:
- `-p`: Preview (play the video after rendering)
- `-q`: Quality (l=low, m=medium, h=high, k=4K)
- `-l`: Low quality (faster rendering for testing)

## Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's good practice to use a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv manim-env
# On Windows
manim-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source manim-env/bin/activate

pip install manim
```

## Alternative: Using Docker

If you're having trouble with installation, Manim also provides Docker images:

```
docker pull manimcommunity/manim
docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/your/project:/manim" manimcommunity/manim
```

With Manim installed, you can now begin implementing the algorithm visualizations for your INFO 6205 course using the prompts I provided earlier.


1. **Stable Matching (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.
The animation should visualize the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching, showing how participants propose, accept, and reject until a stable matching is reached. Include a small example with 3-4 participants on each side, displaying their preference lists and tracking the matching process step by step.
```

2. **Algorithm Analysis (Big-Oh Notation)**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.
The animation should illustrate Big-Oh notation by comparing growth rates of common functions (constant, logarithmic, linear, n log n, quadratic, exponential). Show these functions on a coordinate system with animations of how they grow as n increases, and include visual representations of their practical implications for algorithm performance.
```

3. **Graph Search Algorithms (BFS/DFS)**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.
The animation should demonstrate both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on the same graph. Display a medium-sized graph (8-10 nodes) and animate how each algorithm traverses the nodes, highlighting the frontier, visited nodes, and the queue/stack data structures used by each algorithm.
```

4. **Greedy Algorithms (Interval Scheduling)**:
```

The animation should visualize the greedy algorithm for interval scheduling. Show a set of intervals on a timeline, and animate the process of selecting intervals that finish earliest and don't overlap with previously selected intervals. Include a comparison with a non-optimal approach to demonstrate why the greedy strategy works.
```

5. **Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort)**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.

Compare the approximation result with an optimal solution.
```

10. **Randomized Algorithms (QuickSort)**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.

The animation should illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. Visualize the process of growing the tree of shortest paths from the source vertex, updating distance estimates for neighboring vertices, and selecting the vertex with the minimum distance at each step.
```

14. **Sorting Algorithms Comparison**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.
The animation should compare multiple sorting algorithms (insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort) running on the same input array. Display the algorithms side by side, highlighting key operations and showing a running count of comparisons and swaps to visualize the different time complexities.
```

15. **Graph Coloring Problem**:
```
Create a Manim animation that renders directly in the current directory, not in a nested media folder.
The animation should demonstrate a greedy approach to the graph coloring problem. Show a graph and animate the process of assigning colors to vertices one by one, ensuring that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Illustrate cases where the greedy approach does and doesn't produce an optimal coloring.
```

These prompts should give you a solid foundation for creating Manim visualizations for each of the core concepts in the INFO 6205 course.
